# a1_c5h1b

CPSC 340 a1 for c5h1b.

[Here's a link to my report](doc/solutions.pdf)
[Here's a link to my code for 3.4](code/grads.py)
[Here's a link to my code for 6.2 and 6.3](code/decision_stump.py)
Note: I did not get my Python running so I was unable to run my code and did not include any figures. However, I coded as much as I could and you can take a look at it. I did not complete 6.4 or 6.5 so there is no need to go through those files. 
The solutions.pdf may have the subsections' numbers labeled incorrectly. I included the section's title so that yoiu know which question it is. For example, 6.2 on the solution is actually 6.6 but I did not know how to format it. Sorry for the confusion.
